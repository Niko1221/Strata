## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 4 min 42 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 61.7 (58.8-65.7) n=3 | 1.26 (1.05-1.26) n=3 | 2.15 (1.82-3.87) n=3 | 7.6 (7.5-8.0) n=3 | 0/3 |
| prompt-4k | 461.9 (459.6-464.0) n=3 | 54.4 (52.3-55.8) n=3 | 8.89 (8.85-8.94) n=3 | 15.95 (15.74-16.16) n=2 | 18.3 (18.0-18.7) n=3 | 3/3 |
| prompt-16k | 644.0 (642.5-646.7) n=3 | 56.7 (55.7-60.3) n=3 | 25.48 (25.37-25.54) n=3 | 30.83 (29.13-32.53) n=2 | 34.5 (33.8-34.6) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

Concurrency rounds (four requests released together):

| Round | Wall s | Output tokens | Aggregate tok/s | Failed |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: concurrency-r2-c1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered no request before this run (a freshly loaded engine).
