- Track: **default** (v0.2.2 source build for gfx1030 (ROCm 10.0.0), setup's own config (no gfx103x switches))
- Context 131072 tokens; server capacity 1 slot(s)
- Sampling: temperature 1.0, top_p 0.95, top_k 20, min_p 0.0, presence_penalty 0.0, repetition_penalty 1.0, reasoning_effort xhigh; thinking on, preserved
- Engine options: `config.json`; chat template: `provenance/chat_template.jinja`

## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 5 min 41 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 44.3 (41.2-45.4) n=3 | 1.54 (1.44-1.55) n=3 | 4.24 (3.66-4.73) n=3 | 9.3 (7.6-12.8) n=3 | 1/3 |
| prompt-4k | 504.5 (503.4-510.1) n=3 | 39.5 (38.5-39.7) n=3 | 8.16 (8.07-8.17) n=3 | not measured | 21.1 (21.0-21.3) n=3 | 3/3 |
| prompt-16k | 539.9 (539.0-543.4) n=3 | 45.0 (41.4-46.4) n=3 | 30.40 (30.20-30.45) n=3 | 34.92 (34.26-38.33) n=3 | 41.7 (41.5-42.5) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

| Phase | Planned | Completed | Truncated | Failed | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered no request before this run (a freshly loaded engine).
