## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 3 min 10 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 75.5 (72.4-76.5) n=3 | 0.58 (0.51-0.62) n=3 | 2.03 (1.76-2.03) n=3 | 5.1 (4.5-5.3) n=3 | 0/3 |
| prompt-4k | 1093.7 (836.1-1096.9) n=3 | 70.0 (59.9-70.5) n=3 | 3.78 (3.76-4.94) n=3 | 8.99 (7.50-11.89) n=3 | 12.2 (11.1-12.3) n=3 | 3/3 |
| prompt-16k | 1197.3 (1196.5-1198.0) n=3 | 65.3 (60.2-71.7) n=3 | 13.73 (13.73-13.74) n=3 | 18.79 (17.85-19.73) n=2 | 21.6 (20.9-22.2) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

| Phase | Planned | Completed | Truncated | Failed | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Sanity checks: **12 of 12**.

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered 22 request(s) before this run.
