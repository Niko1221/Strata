- Engine options: `config.json`; chat template: `provenance/chat_template.jinja`

## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 3 min 15 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | 60.4 (59.9-76.6) n=3 | 65.8 (61.1-71.8) n=3 | 1.30 (1.03-1.31) n=3 | 2.92 (1.96-7.10) n=3 | 6.3 (6.1-9.7) n=3 |
| prompt-4k | 768.3 (725.0-770.1) n=3 | 62.4 (62.4-67.8) n=3 | 5.35 (5.34-5.67) n=3 | 10.37 (10.37-10.37) n=1 | 13.5 (12.9-13.9) n=3 |
| prompt-16k | 1238.5 (1235.9-1243.3) n=3 | 69.3 (64.7-69.8) n=3 | 13.26 (13.21-13.29) n=3 | 18.20 (18.07-18.32) n=2 | 20.6 (20.6-21.2) n=3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples.

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered 1 request(s) before this run.
