## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 3 min 39 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 72.6 (71.0-79.6) n=3 | 1.06 (0.95-1.11) n=3 | 3.22 (2.35-6.30) n=3 | 7.4 (4.6-8.2) n=3 | 2/3 |
| prompt-4k | 717.0 (711.9-720.0) n=3 | 69.3 (68.7-73.8) n=3 | 5.74 (5.71-5.78) n=3 | 10.58 (10.58-10.58) n=1 | 13.1 (12.6-13.2) n=3 | 3/3 |
| prompt-16k | 850.2 (845.1-857.5) n=3 | 70.7 (69.3-75.9) n=3 | 19.31 (19.16-19.43) n=3 | 23.65 (23.65-23.65) n=1 | 26.5 (25.9-26.8) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

| Phase | Planned | Completed | Truncated | Failed | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r2: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered no request before this run (a freshly loaded engine).
