# Strata: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 30/40/50, 12+ GB VRAM; two or
# three cards can share one model, 8 GB each - docs/MULTI_GPU.md).
#
# The engine is compiled during docker build, so the first container start only
# downloads the model (~70 GB) and starts the server. docker build has no GPU,
# so the CUDA architectures are fixed here instead of read from nvidia-smi: the
# engine is a fat binary with a cubin per listed arch, and the runtime picks the
# one matching your card. Narrow CUDA_ARCHITECTURES to your card for a faster
# build; a card outside the set needs a rebuild with its own arch.
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t strata .
#   docker build -t strata --build-arg CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89 .        # RTX 40 only
#   docker build -t strata --build-arg CUDA_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:12.9.2-devel-ubuntu24.04 #CUDA12 
#
# Run (host needs an NVIDIA driver >= 580 and nvidia-container-toolkit):
#   docker run --rm --gpus all \
#     -p 8080:8080 \
#     --ulimit memlock=-1 \
#     -v strata-data:/data \
#     -e MODEL=IQ2_XS \
#     strata
#
# Setup choices are env vars, read by docker-entrypoint.sh: FAMILY, MODEL, CONTEXT,
# VISION (no | yes | cpu), KV (int8 | q4_0 | k8v4), GPU (one card) or GPUS ("0,2"
# or "all", with LAYER_SPLIT), LOW_RAM (auto | on | off), HOST, PORT, API_KEY,
# GGUF_DIR (GGUF files you already have), RESIDENT_BUDGET_GIB, KV_STREAMING.
#
# Only the model files, the prepared pack, the MTP layer and the install config
# live in the /data volume; the engine is part of the image. Strata loads 32-62 GB
# into RAM, so a capped container needs -e LOW_RAM=on: setup.py reads the RAM from
# /proc/meminfo, which here is the host's total, not the container's limit. Add an
# API key before exposing the port to a network: -e API_KEY=<secret>. Pass
# -e REINSTALL=1 to change the model settings later.
#
# --gpus all on a host with two usable cards: setup takes both (the layer split is
# its recommended default). Pin one card with -e GPU=0, or name them with
# -e GPUS=0,2. A volume set up for one card switches to the pair on its first start
# on a two-card host unless GPU or GPUS pins it. LOW_RAM=on runs on one card.
