// include/strata/spec/window_rule.hpp - which rule picks a round's verify window, by the round's ACTIVE draft source.
//
// `use_mtp` means "the MTP layer is loaded"; with DFlash2 it stays true because the MTP is the fallback.  The decisions below
// read what the MTP chain just produced (the cost-aware rule's `chain_rows`, the draft probabilities), so they apply only when
// the MTP chain is the source of this round's candidates.  With DFlash2 as the source, `chain_rows` is never written (the chain
// callback does not run) and would pin the window at one row.  Header only, no device types: the CLI loop and the serve loop of
// every backend call it.
