// include/strata/prefill/pf_fused_override.hpp - one process-wide switch that turns the fused prompt experts off after the environment was read.
//
// STRATA_PF_FUSED is read once by several static caches (moe_fused.cu, moe_fused_iq.cu, prefill.cpp's per-device fused_ring answer).  The small-card
// prompt path (strata::small_card_prompt_path in core/sm120_series.hpp) is decided in `serve` only after the expert cache is sized, because it keys on the
// prompt chunk the default path would get, so it cannot set the variable early.  It sets this instead; every one of those readers asks it first.
// -1: nothing was decided (the environment and the card's table rule), 0: the fused prompt experts are off for this process.
