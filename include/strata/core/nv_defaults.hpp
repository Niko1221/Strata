// strata/core/nv_defaults.hpp - the per-architecture defaults of switches that are exact (bitwise) on NVIDIA sm_86 and sm_60.
//
// 148-nv measured every switch of the 0.1.45 bit-exact ON set, one at a time and in the stacked set, on an RTX 3060, an RTX A4000
// (sm_86) and a Tesla P100 (sm_60): a switch is in a table only when its token ids equal the default's and it was faster on that
// architecture (5+ interleaved pairs of fresh engines, noise arm, equal expert-cache slots; notes-148-nv.md).  The identity gate
// (10 prompts + exact_pp 4K/20K, fixed flags) is IDENTICAL with the whole table on.  Switches that change bits, hang or lost speed
// on a card (STRATA_EXCHANGE_ROTATE, STRATA_PCIE_BALANCE, STRATA_QSA_WARP, ...) are not in any table.
//
//   STRATA_SM86_PERF=0   turns the sm_86 table off (cards of compute capability 8.6: RTX 3050-3090, RTX A2000-A6000)
//   STRATA_SM60_PERF=0   turns the sm_60 table off (Pascal GP100: Tesla P100)
//
// A switch the user set (to anything, including 0) is never overridden.  Applied once at start, before any engine code reads its
// switches; the table is used only when every visible CUDA device has the same compute capability.
