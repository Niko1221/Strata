"""Slot read test (STRATA_SLOT_READ): a conversation's next turn read in the batch slot that holds it gives the
tokens the same turn gives when it is admitted through the main sessions.

Two conversations in two slots, three turns each, run twice on a fresh engine:
  ref    every turn admitted the usual way (BGEN: read on the main sessions, copied into the slot)
  slot   turns 2 and 3 with slot_read=1 (the slot reads the new tokens in its own windows)
Both runs read every prompt through the verify windows (--short-read: the batched read's kernels round
differently) with the expert placement fixed (--pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 1000000), so the rows are the same rows.

Conversation 0's later turns are rendered as a chat client renders them - the history again, the reply without the
template's thinking block - so they leave what the slot holds at the last turn boundary: the read restarts at the
slot's turn checkpoint (turn 3's is the one the slot's own read of turn 2 took).  Conversation 1's continue exactly
what its slot holds.  The two turns of a round are sent back to back, so the second arrives while the first is read.
With --alone a round's turns are sent one after the other instead, each when the one before it has ended: a slot
then reads while the other group stands idle, where the engine sends its windows ahead through that group's rows
(STRATA_SLOT_READ_AHEAD); --later-pad makes the later turns long enough for that to happen many times, and
--expect-ahead fails the test when it did not happen at all.  --stop-read MS (with --alone) stops conversation 1's
later turns MS milliseconds into their read (BSTOP) and sends each again: the turn then goes on from what the slot
had read, and its reply must still be the reference's.

The engine needs the pipelined groups with drafts (a layer split, --batch-mtp, STRATA_PIPED_MTP and
STRATA_BATCH_SELF_COMMIT=0 in the config's env or the shell); the test says so when it does not have them.

  python3 tools/slot_read_test.py --exe engine/strata --config strata-<model>.json \

      [--alone --later-pad 400 --expect-ahead] [--stop-read 300]

Exit 0: every later turn identical in both runs, each of them read in its slot in the slot run; 2: a turn differs
or was not read in its slot; 1: an engine error.
