"""The release gate for a feed model's install, as a test in `python tools/check` (py-tools): a REAL synthetic GGUF installed through setup.py from a signed
test feed (throw-away key) and a local Hugging Face stand-in. See tools/feed_model_install_gate.py for what it does and checks; it catches the Q4-P8 rehearsal's
F2 (KeyError 'mmproj'), F3 (the Flash-Next draft layer fetched for `drafter: none`), F4 (the shipped expert profile of another shape) and F5 (no RAM budget, a
second copy of the experts).

    python -m pytest tools/test_feed_model_install_realfile.py

Needs a llama.cpp checkout for its gguf-py (env STRATA_TEST_LLAMA_CPP, or a known place) and numpy; without them the test is SKIPPED with that reason, which
`tools/check` prints. The engine step (one request) is the gate script's own --engine option and needs a box with an engine built for the file's shape.
