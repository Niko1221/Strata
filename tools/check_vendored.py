"""Verify third_party/strata-ggml against its manifest (UPSTREAM.md).   python tools/check_vendored.py [--upstream <llama.cpp dir>]

The vendored ggml / ggml-cuda sources are frozen at the llama.cpp commit named in UPSTREAM.md.  The manifest lists every file with its
kind and sha256 (text files are hashed with LF line ends, so a Windows checkout agrees with a Linux one):

  upstream   identical to the file at the pinned commit
  edited     a Strata edit of an upstream file (the edit is described in UPSTREAM.md); the row also holds the upstream sha256
  added      a file that is Strata's own (not in llama.cpp)
  copy       ggml/src/ggml-cuda-tq/X: a verbatim copy of its pristine counterpart (ggml-cuda/X; ggml-cuda-tq/include/X is include/X); the row holds the
             counterpart's hash.  The trellis (Gyro) MMQ build compiles its headers from this folder, which is first on strata_mmq's include path,
             so a header that includes mmq.cuh by name has to sit beside the patched mmq.cuh
  patched    the same, with additions (checked here: every line of the counterpart is still there, in order; only lines were added)

Checks: every listed file exists and has the listed hash; no file of the tree is missing from the list; the pin equals
third_party/ggml/VERSION.txt; the LICENSE is there; every `edited` row names its upstream hash.  With --upstream <dir> the upstream
hashes are also checked against that checkout (the files at the pin, e.g. `git archive` of the commit): `upstream` rows must equal the file
there, `edited` rows must carry its hash.  Standard library only.  Exit 0 clean, 1 on any problem.
