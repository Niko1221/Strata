"""The conversation context a model starts with: 128K on every card, unless the person picks another (owner, 2026-11-01).

One rule for the app (apps/host/src/lib/default-context.ts says the same), the Terminal (`strata launch`, `setup`) and the MCP tools: 128K, or the
largest size the model offers when that is under 128K (DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash: up to its pack's own limit). The VRAM tiers that used to lower it on small
cards are gone; a card that 128K leaves little room on gets a warning, never a lower number (the engine says plainly if it cannot start).
A Mac keeps its unified-memory rule (strata_control/mac_fit.py), which the owner has not changed.
