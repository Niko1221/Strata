"""Paths in a saved run config that name a version folder of Strata's own components, and what to do when an update has removed that folder.

Setup writes absolute paths into the run config: ``cwd`` and ``--expert-profile`` into the Control bundle that ran it
(``<components>/control/<version>/...``), the picture reader and library folders into an engine package
(``<components>/engine/<version>-<platform>-<backend>/...``), the DeepSeek engine into ``engine-dsv41/<version>-.../``.  An update puts the new version
beside the old one and removes the versions older than the one before, so the second update after a model was set up deleted the folders its config
names: the model showed as "not installed" and a start failed (#4891; "Qwen breaks each time Strata is updated").

One resolver, used by both sides:

* ``resolve_config(cfg)`` (pure; ``profiles.read_run_config`` calls it, so the doctor, the model list, the launch plan and the runtime host see the
  current folders without a file being written);
* ``repair(configs)`` (runtime.start calls it for the profile being started and every saved profile): the same, written once into the file, one plain
  line for each file it changed.

Only paths in Strata's own folders are touched (``components/control``, ``components/engine``, ``engine-dsv41``), and only when the version folder they
name is GONE; a path the person typed themselves, a model or pack folder, or a version folder that still exists is left exactly as it is.  A path whose
file is nowhere in the current version either is not guessed: ``unresolved`` names it.
