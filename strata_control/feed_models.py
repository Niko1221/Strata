"""The model list in the signed update feed (feed member ``models``): the cache of the last verified list, and how a feed model becomes a catalog entry.

A new model can ship as a signed feed update, with no new Control package. The feed carries, for each model, the Hugging Face repository at a pinned revision,
every file's exact size and SHA-256, the engine family, the licence and the first engine version that reads it (strata_control/feed.py ``FeedModel``). Setup, the
Terminal's `strata launch` and the app read the SAME tables (setup.py's MODELS / FAMILIES / OWN_PATH_FAMILIES), so a feed model is added to those tables here and
every screen shows it after the built-in ones. It then goes through the code a built-in model goes through: the same pins (REPO_PINS / REV_PINS, HF_REVISIONS), the
same SHA-256 check after the download and the same ``.bad`` handling (setup.py ``download`` / ``verify_sha256`` / ``keep_bad``).

Rules:

* With no ``models`` member in the feed (and no cached one) nothing here changes anything: no table is touched, nothing is written.
* A model whose family the installed engine does not run (``strata --families``) is listed as not available on this engine and is never offered to install.
* Offline, the models of the last feed that verified are shown (the signature is checked again when the cache is read).
* A model that would clash with a built-in one (an id, a tag, a file name pinned to other bytes) is left out with a log line; a built-in model is never replaced.
