"""The engine of one Qwen4 model shape, as its own component (feed member ``shape_engines``), picked by the model.

An engine is compiled for ONE model geometry (``-DSTRATA_GEOMETRY=...``, cmake/strata_geometry.cmake) and refuses a GGUF of another one at load. The Strata engine is
built for Flash-Next. A Qwen4 model of a different shape therefore ships with its own engine package, and that package never replaces the Strata engine:

* name: the shape is the compiled geometry's name (``q4_lite``); its component is ``strata-q4-lite``; a feed model of that shape has the family ``qwen4exp_q4_lite``;
* place: ``<components>/shapes/<shape>/engine/<version>-<platform>-<backend>[-<variant>]/``, beside the Strata engine's ``<components>/engine/`` and never inside it. The
  manifest's id is the shape's component (``strata-q4-lite``) and it carries ``"shape"``, so the Strata engine's scan never reads it and an older Control (which reads only
  ``strata-engine``) refuses one that was copied into its engine folder;
* feed: member ``shape_engines`` (the same entry as ``engine``, plus ``shape``). A Control from before this member ignores it, and ignores the models of those shapes too (their
  family is one it does not know);
* use: the run config of a model of that shape says ``"exe": "component:strata-q4-lite"``. Every start asks ``engine_component.expand``, which resolves it in the shape's folder
  (checks every file's SHA-256 and the signature, as for the Strata engine). The Strata engine and every model that runs on it are not touched;
* fetch: setup (the app's Download and the Terminal's launch) fetches the shape's engine through the signed feed when the model is chosen, as it does for DeepSeek's. An explicit
  `strata update` brings an installed shape engine up to date. Starting a model never downloads anything.

Nothing in this module imports anything outside the standard library and ``strata_control`` at load time.
