"""An engine update beside a loaded model: the notice, the warning, the clean stop and the start again.

The rule (owner, 11-01): an engine update never starts by itself while a model is loaded, and nothing replaces or removes the engine a running
model uses.  An update that finds a model loaded does one of three things, and never a fourth:

* nobody can be asked (a script, the app without a dialog, a service): it stops BEFORE any download and changes nothing (exit 7), and says
  the two next steps;
* the person said yes (the question in a terminal, ``--stop-model`` in a script): the new engine is downloaded while the model keeps
  serving, then the model is stopped cleanly, the update is made, and the model is started again with the same settings when the person says so
  (the question in a terminal, ``--start-again`` in a script; otherwise it stays stopped and the way to start it is printed);
* the person said no: nothing is changed (exit 0).

``ModelGate`` is the one object the update (strata_control/updater.py) calls at its two points: ``consent`` before anything is downloaded, and
``release`` after the download, right before the first thing is staged or test-started.  ``update_with_models`` runs a whole update around it
and starts the models again afterwards, also when the update failed (the old engine is still in use).

``notice`` is the one quiet line the Terminal shows when the last check found a newer engine.  It reads the cached check only (a local
file) and never touches the network, so showing it breaks no rule.  ``refresh_cache`` is the daily check, written but not called by anything:
adding it to a screen is one line, and waits for the owner's yes (the Terminal learns of a new engine only from a check somebody made).
