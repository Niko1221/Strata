"""The engines installed on this computer: list them, switch to any of them, delete one. Local only: nothing here downloads.

One truth for the app (Settings > Engine) and the Terminal (`strata components engines | use | remove | rollback`). Updates keep every older
engine (strata_control/updater.py), so a person can go back to an older engine to test something and return to the newest later.

Two families, two mechanisms, one list:

* the Qwen engine (and every model but DeepSeek): packages in ``<components>/engine/<version>-<platform>-<backend>[-<variant>]/``. What a start runs
  is the pinned package (``.updates/state.json`` engine.pinned), else the newest that fits this PC (engine_component.resolve).
* the DeepSeek engine (strata-dsv41): packages in ``engine-dsv41/``. A saved profile's run config names its program; the person's choice is the
  ``.chosen`` file in that folder (dsv41_paths.PIN), which every place that picks a package reads, and the saved configs are pointed at it.

The two never touch each other's files or state: switching or deleting one family leaves the other as it was.

A switch warns, it does not refuse, wherever the engine can run at all. What cannot be switched to is a package this computer cannot run (another
operating system or make of graphics card, a driver that is too old, damaged files, a Strata that is too old for it). The engine in use cannot be
deleted, nor one a running program uses.
